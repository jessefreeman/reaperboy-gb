# Edge Validation Rollback - Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the rollback of edge validation logic that was preventing certain platform patterns from being placed at the left and right edges of the tilemap. The rollback ensures that entering a code letter always draws the corresponding pattern tile-by-tile, just like manual painting, without any edge restrictions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified `is_pattern_valid` Function

**Location**: `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c`

**Before**:

- Complex validation logic that checked for isolated platforms at left/right edges
- Blocked patterns with isolated platforms at positions 0 (left edge) or 4 (right edge)

**After**:

```c
UBYTE is_pattern_valid(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED
{
    // Simple validation: just check if pattern_id is within valid range
    // All patterns are now allowed at all positions (no edge restrictions)
    return (pattern_id < PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT) ? 1 : 0;
}
```

### 2. Removed `find_valid_pattern` Function

**Location**: `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` and `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/include/code_gen.h`

- Completely removed the function that was searching for "valid" patterns
- Removed the function declaration from the header file
- This function is no longer needed since all patterns are now valid at all positions

### 3. Simplified Character Cycling Logic

**Location**: `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` in `handle_dpad_input`

**Before**:

- Complex logic that searched for the next "valid" pattern using validation
- Could skip patterns that were deemed invalid at edge positions

**After**:

```c
if (char_index < TOTAL_BLOCKS)
{
    // Platform patterns: cycle through 0 to PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT-1
    max_value = PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT - 1;
    new_value = (current_value + 1) % PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT;
}
```

### 4. Simplified Code Entry Logic

**Location**: `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` in `update_level_code_from_character_edit`

**Before**:

- Used `find_valid_pattern` to find acceptable patterns
- Could refuse to apply a pattern if deemed invalid

**After**:

```c
if (char_index < TOTAL_BLOCKS)
{
    // Platform pattern positions (0-15)
    if (new_value < PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT)
    {
        // Apply the pattern directly - no validation restrictions
        current_level_code.platform_patterns[char_index] = new_value;
        apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(char_index, new_value);
    }
}
```

## Behavior After Rollback

### Code Entry

- Entering any valid code letter (0-9, A-K for patterns 0-20) will **always** draw the corresponding pattern
- No restrictions based on tilemap position (left edge, right edge, etc.)
- Pattern is applied tile-by-tile using the same brush logic as manual painting

### Character Cycling

- Using UP/DOWN inputs cycles through **all** available patterns (0-20)
- No patterns are skipped due to edge position restrictions
- Simple wrap-around cycling: 0→1→2→...→20→0

### Pattern Application

- All patterns use `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic` for consistent tile-by-tile placement
- Auto-completion and merging behavior matches manual painting exactly
- Both visual tilemap and internal level code are updated consistently

## Code Quality

- Simplified validation logic reduces complexity
- Removed unused functions (`find_valid_pattern`)
- Cleaner, more predictable behavior
- Consistent with manual painting workflow

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test entering patterns at left edge blocks (0, 4, 8, 12)
2. Test entering patterns at right edge blocks (3, 7, 11, 15)
3. Verify patterns are applied tile-by-tile with proper auto-completion
4. Confirm character cycling works smoothly through all patterns
5. Test loading levels to ensure `reconstruct_tilemap_from_level_code` works correctly

## Files Modified

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` - Main implementation
- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/include/code_gen.h` - Function declarations

The rollback is now complete. All patterns can be entered at any position, and the system behaves consistently with manual tilemap painting.
