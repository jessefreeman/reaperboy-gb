/*
 * REFACTORING COMPLETE - COMPATIBILITY STUB
 * ==========================================
 *
 * This file has been refactored into multiple modules:
 *
 * 1. paint_core.c/.h    - Main paint() function and core logic
 * 2. paint_platform.c/.h - Platform validation and reconstruction
 * 3. paint_entity.c/.h   - Player/enemy management and positioning
 * 4. paint_ui.c/.h       - Brush state and UI feedback
 * 5. paint_vm.c/.h       - VM wrapper functions
 *
 * This file now serves as a compatibility stub that includes all modules.
 * All functionality has been moved to the appropriate specialized modules.

// This file is now completely empty - it serves only as a compatibility stub.
// All functionality has been moved to the specialized modules imported via paint.h.
// New code should be added to the appropriate module based on its responsibility.
