# Test Harness - Simplified Events

## Current Status

The events have been simplified to avoid assembly generation errors. They now only:

1. **Test: Start Test Suite** - Adds a comment to the script
2. **Test: Verify Variable** - Shows a simple message about the test
3. **Test: End Test Suite** - Shows completion message

## Quick Test Script

Try this simple script to verify the events work:

```
1. Test: Start Test Suite
   - test_name: "Basic Test"

2. Test: Verify Variable
   - test_name: "Sample Test"

3. Test: End Test Suite
   - show_results: âœ“
```

## Expected Output

You should see:
- "Testing: Sample Test"
- "Tests completed!"

## Next Steps

Once the basic events compile successfully, we can gradually add back the C function calls using proper GB Studio syntax. The key is to:

1. **Start simple** - Get basic events working first
2. **Add C calls incrementally** - One at a time to identify issues
3. **Use proper helpers** - Follow GB Studio's event compilation patterns

This approach will help us identify exactly what's causing the assembly errors and fix them step by step.
