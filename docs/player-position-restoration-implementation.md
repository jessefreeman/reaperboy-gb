# Tilemap Editor Player Position Restoration - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The tilemap editor was not automatically restoring the player position from memory when loading, requiring manual repositioning each time.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified `vm_enable_editor()` Function
**File**: `plugins/TilemapPainter/engine/src/core/paint_vm.c`

**Added**: Call to `update_player_actor_position()` when the editor loads with existing content

**Before**:
```c
else
{
    // Map has content, update level code from existing tilemap
    update_complete_level_code();
}
```

**After**:
```c
else
{
    // Map has content, update level code from existing tilemap
    update_complete_level_code();
    
    // Restore player position from level code and update actors
    update_player_actor_position();
}
```

### 2. Created Additional Initialization Function
**File**: `plugins/TilemapEncoder/engine/src/core/code_level_core.c`

**Function**: `init_tilemap_editor_from_memory()`
- Comprehensive initialization from memory state
- Available as GB Studio event via `vm_init_tilemap_editor_from_memory()`

### 3. Added GB Studio Event
**File**: `plugins/TilemapEncoder/events/eventInitTilemapEditorFromMemory.js`

**Event**: "Initialize Tilemap Editor from Memory"
- Alternative initialization method for memory-based restoration

## Usage in GB Studio

### Primary Method (Recommended)
Use the existing **"Enable Editor"** event which now automatically handles player positioning:

```
Scene: "Tilemap Editor"
├── On Init:
│   └── Enable Editor
```

### Alternative Method
For specific memory restoration scenarios:

```
Scene: "Tilemap Editor"  
├── On Init:
│   └── Initialize Tilemap Editor from Memory
```

## Automatic Functionality

When the tilemap editor loads, it now automatically:

✅ **Player Marker**: Places player marker tile at row 11 (editor visualization)
✅ **Player Actor**: Moves player actor to row 0 (gameplay position)  
✅ **Exit Sprite**: Positions exit sprite relative to player
✅ **Level Code**: Updates level code display
✅ **Platform Styling**: Maintains proper platform end caps and visuals

## Benefits

- **No Manual Setup**: Player position is automatically restored
- **Seamless Transitions**: Works for both editor → gameplay and gameplay → editor
- **Visual Accuracy**: All elements positioned correctly for both modes
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing "Enable Editor" event now does more
- **Flexible**: Additional memory restoration event available when needed

## Files Modified

1. `paint_vm.c` - Added player positioning to editor initialization
2. `code_level_core.c` - Added comprehensive memory initialization function
3. `code_level_core.h` - Added function declarations
4. `eventInitTilemapEditorFromMemory.js` - New GB Studio event
5. Documentation updated

The tilemap editor now seamlessly handles player positioning restoration without requiring additional manual setup or event calls.
