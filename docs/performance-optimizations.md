# Performance Optimizations & Bug Fixes

## Overview

This document consolidates all performance optimizations and critical bug fixes implemented in the TilemapEditor plugin system.

## Level Code Display Flicker Fix

### Problem

The level code display was causing flicker because every paint operation triggered a complete redraw of all 24 characters, even when only a single character or zone had changed.

### Solution: Selective Update System

#### Implementation Details

- **Added tracking variables** to monitor what has changed
- **Implemented bit masks** to track which display positions need updating (24-bit system)
- **Created change detection** that compares current vs previous level code state

#### New Functions Added

```c
// Selective update functions
void mark_display_position_for_update(UBYTE position);
UBYTE display_position_needs_update(UBYTE position);
void clear_display_update_flags(void);
void display_selective_level_code_fast(void);

// Smart change detection
void detect_level_code_changes(void);
void force_complete_level_code_display(void);

// Cache management
current_encoded_enemy_data[4];     // Cache for enemy encoding
current_encoded_player_data;       // Cache for player encoding
display_update_mask;               // 32-bit bitmask for tracking updates
```

#### Performance Improvements

- **Before**: Every paint operation → Clear entire display → Redraw all 24 characters
- **After**: Only update the 1-5 characters that actually changed
- **Result**: Eliminated visible flicker, much smoother user experience

### Zone-Specific Updates

- **Platform changes**: Only update the affected 5-character zone
- **Enemy data changes**: Only update characters 20-23
- **Complete updates**: Only for initialization and major operations

## Paint Logic Synchronization Fixes

### Adjacent Block Level Code Sync Fix

#### Problem

When entering code letters that triggered auto-completion into neighboring blocks, the neighboring blocks' level codes were not updated immediately, causing a "one change late" issue.

#### Root Cause

The `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic` function was calling `paint(x, y)` for each tile, but each `paint()` call only updated the level code for the immediate block. Neighboring blocks affected by auto-completion didn't get their level codes updated.

#### Solution

Enhanced `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic` to explicitly update neighboring block codes:

```c
void apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED {
    // ...existing pattern application logic...
    update_neighboring_block_codes(block_index);
}

void update_neighboring_block_codes(UBYTE block_index) BANKED {
    // Check and update horizontal and vertical neighbors
    // Update their level codes if they were affected by auto-completion
}
```

### Paint Toggle Fix

#### Problem

The `paint()` function toggles platform tiles, so calling `paint()` on an existing platform would delete it. Pattern application was inadvertently deleting auto-completed platforms.

#### Solution

Added smart platform detection before calling `paint()`:

```c
// Check if already has correct platform before painting
if (get_meta_tile(tile_x, current_y) != PLATFORM_TILE_2) {
    paint(tile_x, current_y);  // Only paint if needed
}
```

### True Manual Paint Simulation

#### Problem

Pattern application used different logic from manual painting, causing inconsistencies in level code updates and platform behavior.

#### Solution

Rewrote pattern application to literally call the `paint(x, y)` function for each tile:

```c
void apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED {
    // Process tiles from left to right using actual paint() calls
    for (UBYTE i = 0; i < SEGMENT_WIDTH; i++) {
        if ((row_pattern >> (4 - i)) & 1) {
            // Use real paint function for perfect consistency
            paint(tile_x, current_y);
        }
    }
}
```

## Platform Validation Improvements

### 8-Tile Length Limit Enforcement

#### Problem

Users could create visually connected platforms exceeding the 8-tile limit, causing visual-logical inconsistency.

#### Solution

Added comprehensive length validation:

```c
// Direct connection validation
UBYTE count_connected_platform_length(UBYTE x, UBYTE y);

// Auto-merge validation
UBYTE would_2tile_platform_exceed_limit(UBYTE x, UBYTE y);
```

#### Implementation

- **Direct Extension**: Prevents extending existing 8-tile platforms
- **Indirect Merging**: Prevents creating platforms that would auto-merge beyond limits
- **Visual Consistency**: What users see exactly matches internal platform structure

### Single Platform Auto-Completion

#### Problem

Single isolated platform tiles were being removed instead of auto-completed into valid 2-tile platforms.

#### Solution

Added detection and auto-completion for isolated platforms:

```c
// Detect isolated platforms at segment edges
if (is_isolated && i == SEGMENT_WIDTH - 1 && tile_x + 1 <= PLATFORM_X_MAX) {
    paint(tile_x + 1, current_y);  // Auto-complete to 2-tile platform
}
```

## Code Refactoring & Cleanup

### Compilation Warning Cleanup

#### Warning Fixed

`warning 85: unreferenced function argument : 'block_index'` in `is_pattern_valid()`

#### Solution

Removed the unused `is_pattern_valid()` function entirely since it was no longer being called after edge validation rollback.

### Legacy Code Removal

#### Removed Systems

- **Binary encoding system**: Eliminated duplicate 8-byte encoding in favor of 24-character display
- **Edge validation logic**: Simplified to allow all patterns at all positions
- **Unused validation functions**: Removed `find_valid_pattern()` and related logic
- **Debug functions**: Removed test and debug functions not needed in production

#### Code Size Reduction

- **Before**: `code_gen.c` ~1012 lines, `paint.c` ~1035 lines
- **After**: `code_gen_optimized.c` ~400 lines, `paint_optimized.c` ~350 lines
- **Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### Edge Validation Rollback

#### Change

Removed complex validation logic that blocked certain patterns at tilemap edges.

#### Result

- All patterns now work at all positions
- Code entry always draws the corresponding pattern tile-by-tile
- Consistent behavior between manual painting and code entry
