# TilemapEditor Plugin Refactoring - COMPLETE

## Overview

The monolithic `code_gen.c` file has been successfully refactored into a clean, modular architecture. All cleanup tasks have been completed and verified.

## Final Architecture

### Core Modules

| Module              | Purpose                               | Files                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Coordinator**     | Main coordination and VM wrappers     | `code_gen.c/h`             |
| **Level Core**      | Core types, constants, display system | `code_level_core.c/h`      |
| **Platform System** | Platform pattern management           | `code_platform_system.c/h` |
| **Player System**   | Player positioning logic              | `code_player_system.c/h`   |
| **Enemy System**    | Enemy encoding and management         | `code_enemy_system.c/h`    |
| **Persistence**     | Save/load operations                  | `code_persistence.c/h`     |

### Module Dependencies

```
code_gen.h
├── code_level_core.h (shared types & constants)
├── code_platform_system.h
├── code_player_system.h
├── code_enemy_system.h
└── code_persistence.h
```

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Code Modularization

- [x] Split monolithic `code_gen.c` into 6 focused modules
- [x] Created proper header files for each module
- [x] Established clear module boundaries and responsibilities

### 2. File Organization

- [x] Applied consistent `code_` prefix to all module files
- [x] Removed duplicate and obsolete files
- [x] Updated all include statements and dependencies

### 3. Header Cleanup

- [x] Removed duplicate function declarations from `code_gen.h`
- [x] Added missing function declarations to module headers
- [x] Added proper type definitions (`level_code_t`)
- [x] Updated header guards to match new file names

### 4. Verification

- [x] Verified all function declarations match implementations
- [x] Confirmed no orphaned files remain
- [x] Validated cross-module dependencies
- [x] Checked compilation (no syntax errors)

### 5. Documentation

- [x] Updated project documentation with new structure
- [x] Created comprehensive cleanup summary
- [x] Documented module responsibilities and interfaces

## Benefits Achieved

### Code Quality

- **Maintainability**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Readability**: Code is organized by functional area
- **Testability**: Modules can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: New features can be added to appropriate modules

### Developer Experience

- **Discoverability**: Related files are grouped with consistent naming
- **Navigation**: Clear separation of concerns aids code exploration
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

### Technical Benefits

- **Compilation**: Reduced include dependencies improve build times
- **Memory**: Selective module loading possible for memory-constrained environments
- **Integration**: Clean interfaces facilitate integration with GB Studio

## Final File Structure

```

## Usage

The refactored code maintains full backward compatibility. All existing VM wrapper functions and public APIs remain unchanged. The modular structure is transparent to GB Studio scripts and existing integrations.

## Next Steps

The refactoring is complete and ready for:

1. **Integration testing** with GB Studio
2. **Feature development** using the new modular structure
3. **Performance optimization** of individual modules
4. **Additional functionality** as needed
