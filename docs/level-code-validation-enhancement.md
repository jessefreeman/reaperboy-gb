# Level Code Enemy Validation Enhancement

## Problem
The level code editing system was not properly validating enemy positions and direction/odd masks, allowing users to:
1. Set invalid enemy positions (like "P" for the 2nd enemy when no valid position exists)
2. Set direction/flip bits for non-existent enemies 
3. Keep changing flip values without limit, even when no enemies exist at those positions

## Root Causes
1. **Weak Position Validation**: When `is_position_valid_for_enemy()` returned false, the code fell back to `get_valid_enemy_pos41()` which may not find a truly valid position, but still accepted the change.
2. **No Mask Validation**: The direction mask (character 23) and odd mask (character 22) validation only checked if the value was in range 0-31, but didn't verify that the bits correspond to actual existing enemies.

## Solution

### Enhanced Position Validation
Updated `handle_enemy_data_edit()` to be more strict about position validation:

```c
// Use enemy-specific validation that properly handles spacing
if (is_position_valid_for_enemy(rel_index, x, y))
{
    // Position is valid, use it
    enemy_values[rel_index] = new_value;
}
else
{
    // Invalid position, keep the current value (don't change)
    enemy_values[rel_index] = encode_enemy_position(rel_index);
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- When a position is invalid, the system now keeps the old value instead of trying to find an alternative
- This prevents invalid values like "P" from being accepted when no valid position exists
- Adds validation for out-of-range POS41 values (>40)

### Enhanced Mask Validation
Added proper validation for both odd mask (character 22) and direction mask (character 23):

```c
// For direction mask, only allow bits for existing enemies
UBYTE valid_dir_mask = 0;
for (UBYTE i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (enemy_values[i] != 0) // Enemy exists
    {
        // Allow the direction bit for this enemy
        if (new_value & (1 << i))
            valid_dir_mask |= (1 << i);
    }
}
enemy_values[rel_index] = valid_dir_mask;
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Direction bits can only be set for enemies that actually exist (position != 0)
- Odd bits can only be set for enemies that actually exist
- Prevents meaningless direction changes for non-existent enemies
- Automatically clears invalid bits while preserving valid ones

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix
- ❌ Could set 2nd enemy to "P" even when invalid
- ❌ Could flip direction bits for non-existent enemies indefinitely
- ❌ Invalid positions were sometimes accepted through fallback logic

### After Fix  
- ✅ Invalid enemy positions are rejected, old value is preserved
- ✅ Direction/flip bits can only be set for existing enemies
- ✅ Mask editing automatically filters out invalid bits
- ✅ System maintains data integrity by refusing invalid changes

## Files Modified
- `plugins/TilemapEncoder/engine/src/core/code_enemy_system.c`
  - Enhanced position validation in `handle_enemy_data_edit()`
  - Added mask-specific validation for characters 22 and 23
  - Improved error handling to preserve valid data when invalid input is provided

## Result
The level code editing system now strictly enforces the same validation rules as the paint tool:
- Enemy positions must be valid (platform below, proper spacing, not below player)
- Direction/odd masks can only affect enemies that actually exist
- Invalid user input is rejected rather than corrupted or partially accepted
