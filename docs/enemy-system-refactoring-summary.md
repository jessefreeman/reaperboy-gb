# Enemy System Refactoring - Summary

## Objective
Refactor the enemy system so that enemy placement and persistence work correctly in both play and edit modes. Ensure enemy positions are stored in the level code (not inferred from background tiles), actors are used for enemies in both modes, and switching between modes does not clear or reset enemy data.

## Key Changes Completed

### 1. Level Code as Single Source of Truth
- **Modified**: `extract_enemy_data()` in `code_enemy_system.c` is now a no-op
- **Result**: Enemy data is no longer extracted from background tiles - level code is the authoritative source

### 2. Removed Background Tile Drawing for Enemies
- **Modified**: `decode_enemy_position()` and `decode_enemy_data_from_values()` 
- **Result**: These functions only update data structures and actors, never background tiles
- **Impact**: Enemies are represented only as actors, not as tiles on the background

### 3. Unified Actor Management for Both Modes
- **Modified**: `place_enemy_actor()` and `restore_enemy_actors_from_level_code()`
- **Result**: Actors are activated in both play and edit modes
- **Behavior**: 
  - Play mode: Enemies are visible and moving
  - Edit mode: Enemies are visible but stationary (for editing)

### 4. FIFO Slot Management for Consistency
- **Modified**: `restore_enemy_actors_from_level_code()` to use painting system's slot management
- **Result**: Consistent enemy slot allocation between play and edit modes
- **Impact**: Seamless switching between modes without actor conflicts

### 5. Actor-Based Enemy Detection and Removal
- **Modified**: `remove_enemies_above_platform()` in `paint_entity.c`
- **Changed**: From tile-based detection to actor position-based detection
- **Result**: Proper enemy removal when platforms are deleted in edit mode
- **Behavior**: Updates level code when enemies are removed

### 6. Disabled Background Tile Extraction
- **Modified**: `paint_core.c` and `code_level_core.c`
- **Changed**: All calls to `extract_enemy_data()` are commented out
- **Result**: No more background-to-level-code synchronization attempts

## Files Modified

### Core Enemy System
- `plugins/TilemapEncoder/engine/src/core/code_enemy_system.c`
- `plugins/TilemapEncoder/engine/include/code_enemy_system.h`

### Painting/Editor System  
- `plugins/TilemapPainter/engine/src/core/paint_entity.c`
- `plugins/TilemapPainter/engine/include/paint_entity.h`
- `plugins/TilemapPainter/engine/src/core/paint_core.c`

### Level Code Management
- `plugins/TilemapEncoder/engine/src/core/code_level_core.c`

## System Behavior After Refactoring

### Edit Mode
- Enemies are visible as actors (stationary)
- Enemy painting works through brush system but stores in level code
- Enemy deletion works by detecting actors and updating level code
- Platform deletion removes enemies above it automatically

### Play Mode  
- Enemies are visible as actors (moving/active)
- Enemy positions and behavior loaded from level code
- No tile-based enemy logic

### Mode Switching
- Enemy data persists between modes via level code
- Actor slots are managed consistently
- No data loss or duplication when switching modes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enemy Storage
- **Before**: Mixed background tiles + level code
- **After**: Level code only (single source of truth)

### Actor Management
- **Before**: Different logic for play vs edit modes
- **After**: Unified logic, mode only affects movement/behavior

### Slot Management
- **Before**: Inconsistent slot allocation
- **After**: FIFO-based slot management for consistency

### Collision/Detection
- **Before**: Tile-based collision detection for editing
- **After**: Actor position-based detection

## Compilation Status
- ✅ All syntax errors resolved
- ✅ No compilation errors in modified files
- ✅ Engine version compatibility resolved (4.2.0-e7)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Enemy actors visible in edit mode
- [ ] Enemy painting works and updates level code
- [ ] Enemy deletion works and updates level code  
- [ ] Platform deletion removes enemies above
- [ ] Mode switching preserves enemy data
- [ ] Play mode enemy behavior works correctly
- [ ] No background tile artifacts from old system

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Consistency**: Same enemy representation in both modes
2. **Reliability**: Single source of truth eliminates sync issues
3. **Performance**: No background tile scanning for enemies
4. **Maintainability**: Unified actor management logic
5. **User Experience**: Seamless mode switching without data loss
