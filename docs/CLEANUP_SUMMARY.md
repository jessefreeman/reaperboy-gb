# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Analyzed & Consolidated Documentation

- Reviewed 20+ individual markdown files for duplicates and overlapping content
- Identified core themes and feature areas
- Merged related documentation into comprehensive guides

### âœ… Verified Against Current Codebase

- Examined current plugin implementation in `plugins/TilemapEditor/`
- Updated documentation to reflect actual implementation status
- Noted areas where documentation references partially implemented features

### âœ… Created Organized Documentation Structure

**New Documentation Location**: `docs/` folder

**Organized into 6 Core Documents**:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Main index and navigation
2. **[level-code-system.md](level-code-system.md)** - Complete level code documentation
3. **[platform-paint-system.md](platform-paint-system.md)** - Platform creation and validation
4. **[code-entry-mode.md](code-entry-mode.md)** - Code entry mode system
5. **[performance-optimizations.md](performance-optimizations.md)** - All bug fixes and optimizations
6. **[plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md)** - Plugin structure and migration
7. **[development-history.md](development-history.md)** - Implementation notes and decisions

### âœ… Removed Duplicates & Consolidated Content

**Merged Topics**:

- **Level Code Systems**: Combined encoding, persistence, and display documentation
- **Platform Logic**: Merged paint system, validation, and cleanup documentation
- **Performance Fixes**: Consolidated all flicker fixes, sync issues, and optimizations
- **Architecture**: Unified plugin migration and structure documentation

### âœ… Updated Implementation Status

**Verified as Implemented**:

- âœ… Level code system with variable persistence
- âœ… Platform paint logic with validation
- âœ… Performance optimizations (flicker fix, selective updates)
- âœ… Plugin architecture migration

**Flagged as Partially Implemented**:

- ðŸ”„ Code entry mode (events exist, core functions need verification)

### âœ… Enhanced Navigation & Usability

**Improvements**:

- Clear table of contents in main README
- Cross-references between related documents
- Quick start guides for different user types
- Implementation status clearly marked
- Setup requirements clearly documented

## Files Preserved

**Kept in Root Directory**:

- `notes.md` - Simple game mode toggle notes
- `notes-2.md` - Raw pattern data and encoding experiments

These were preserved as they contain raw development notes and experimental data that may be useful for future reference.

## Documentation Benefits

### For Developers

- **Clear Architecture**: Easy to understand plugin structure and component relationships
- **Implementation Guidance**: Detailed examples and usage patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Organized by feature area with cross-references

### For Users

- **Setup Instructions**: Clear requirements and configuration steps
- **Feature Documentation**: Complete coverage of all available functionality
- **Integration Guide**: How to use with GB Studio projects

### For Maintainers

- **Development History**: Context for implementation decisions
- **Edge Cases**: Documented solutions to complex problems
- **Future Planning**: Clear extensibility points and considerations

The documentation is now well-organized, comprehensive, and aligned with the current codebase implementation.
