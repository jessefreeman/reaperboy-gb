## Quick Start Guide

### For Game Developers

1. **Setup Variables**: Create 6 global variables in GB Studio for level persistence
2. **Update Variable IDs**: Modify the `#define VAR_LEVEL_CODE_PART_X` values in `code_gen.c`
3. **Use Events**: Add TilemapEditor events to your scenes for level editing functionality

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Review Architecture**: Start with [Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md)
2. **Understand Core Systems**: Read [Level Code System](level-code-system.md) and [Platform Paint System](platform-paint-system.md)
3. **Study Implementation**: Check [Development History](development-history.md) for context and decisions

### For Troubleshooting

1. **Performance Issues**: See [Performance Optimizations](performance-optimizations.md)
2. **Integration Problems**: Check [Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md) for requirements
3. **Behavior Issues**: Review [Platform Paint System](platform-paint-system.md) for validation rules

- **Extensions**: Modular architecture supports future enhancements

## Contributing

When extending or modifying the plugin:

1. **Follow Architecture**: Maintain the current separation between engine and events
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep docs synchronized with implementation changes
3. **Test Integration**: Verify GB Studio compatibility and performance
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Review existing edge case handling for consistency

## Support

For issues, questions, or contributions:

- Review the appropriate documentation section
- Check [Development History](development-history.md) for similar issues
- Examine the current implementation in `plugins/TilemapEditor/`
- Consider the integration requirements and plugin architecture

This documentation provides complete coverage of the TilemapEditor plugin system, from high-level architecture to specific implementation details.
