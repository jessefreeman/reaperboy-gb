## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. Add the Tilemap Editor plugin to your GB Studio project
2. Add "Setup Paint Actors" event to your scene
3. Add "Enable Editor" event when triggered by player input
4. Connect paint events to player controls

### Basic Controls

```
D-PAD:        Move cursor
A Button:     Paint at cursor position
B Button:     Delete at cursor position
SELECT:       Cycle between tools (platform, player, enemy)
```

### Loading & Saving

```
Save Level:   Stores current design to variables
Load Level:   Restores previously saved design
Copy Code:    Displays 24-character level code for sharing
```

## Plugin Features

### Level Design

- Interactive platform painting with auto-validation
- Player and enemy placement with position validation
- Real-time visual feedback for valid/invalid actions
- Automatic platform rule enforcement (2-8 tile length)

### Level Code System

- Compact 24-character encoding for level designs
- Variable-based persistence across game sessions
- Smart zone-based updates for performance
- Pattern matching for efficient storage

### Integration

- Compatible with standard GB Studio workflow
- Uses native actor system for visual representation
- Suitable for in-game level editors and debug tools
- Easy to extend with additional tile types

## Quick Start Guide

### For Game Developers

1. **Setup Variables**: Create 6 global variables in GB Studio for level persistence
2. **Update Variable IDs**: Modify the `#define VAR_LEVEL_CODE_PART_X` values in `code_gen.c`
3. **Use Events**: Add TilemapEditor events to your scenes for level editing functionality

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Review Architecture**: Start with [Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md)
2. **Understand Core Systems**: Read [Level Code System](level-code-system.md) and [Platform Paint System](platform-paint-system.md)
3. **Study Implementation**: Check [Development History](development-history.md) for context and decisions

### For Troubleshooting

1. **Performance Issues**: See [Performance Optimizations](performance-optimizations.md)
2. **Integration Problems**: Check [Plugin Architecture](plugin-architecture.md) for requirements
3. **Behavior Issues**: Review [Platform Paint System](platform-paint-system.md) for validation rules

## Key Features Summary

### âœ… Implemented & Tested
