# Platform Paint Logic - Comprehensive Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Direct Platform Extension Beyond 8 Tiles**

**Problem**: Users could extend existing 8-tile platforms by clicking adjacent tiles
**Solution**: Added `count_connected_platform_length()` to check total length before allowing direct connections

### 2. **Indirect Auto-Merge Violations**

**Problem**: Users could create 2-tile platforms that auto-merged with nearby platforms, exceeding 8-tile limit
**Solution**: Added `would_2tile_platform_exceed_limit()` to check if new platforms would cause problematic auto-merging

## Functions Added

### `count_connected_platform_length(UBYTE x, UBYTE y)`

- Calculates total platform length if a tile is placed at (x, y)
- Scans left and right to count existing connected platform tiles
- Used for direct connection validation

### `would_2tile_platform_exceed_limit(UBYTE x, UBYTE y)`

- Checks if creating a 2-tile platform starting at (x, y) would exceed limits after auto-merge
- Separately counts left and right platforms that would merge
- Calculates total: left_length + 2 + right_length
- Returns true if total > 8

## Updated Logic

### Platform Placement (paint.c)

```c
// Direct connection check
if (left == BRUSH_TILE_PLATFORM || right == BRUSH_TILE_PLATFORM)
{
    UBYTE platform_length = count_connected_platform_length(x, y);
    if (platform_length > PLATFORM_MAX_LENGTH)
    {
        return; // Block extension
    }
    // Allow connection
}

// New platform creation check
else if (can_create_2tile_platform)
{
    if (would_2tile_platform_exceed_limit(x, y))
    {
        return; // Block creation
    }
    // Allow creation
}
```

### Selector Preview (paint.c)

- Updated `get_platform_placement_type()` to use both validation functions
- Shows correct preview states based on comprehensive length checks
- No longer shows connection/creation icons when limits would be exceeded

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **8-tile platform extension**: Blocked completely
✅ **7-tile + 2-tile = 9-tile auto-merge**: Blocked  
✅ **6-tile + 2-tile = 8-tile auto-merge**: Allowed
✅ **Complex multi-platform gaps**: Checked comprehensively
✅ **Boundary conditions**: Proper handling of map edges
✅ **Selector state consistency**: Preview matches actual placement rules

## Result

- **Perfect Visual-Logical Consistency**: What users see exactly matches internal platform structure
- **Predictable Behavior**: 8-tile limit enforced in all scenarios
- **No Workarounds**: Users cannot circumvent the limit through any placement strategy
- **Clear Feedback**: Selector states accurately reflect what actions are possible

The platform system now maintains strict 8-tile limits while providing intuitive, consistent user experience.
