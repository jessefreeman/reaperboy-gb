# Pattern Drawing System Refactor -### 2. Updated Code Entry System

**Change**: Modified `update_level_code_from_character_edit()` to use the new bru2. **Auto-Completion**: Single platforms at edges get completed consistently  
3. **Platform Merging**: Adjacent platforms merge using identical rules 4. **Length Limits**: 8-tile limit enforced uniformly 5. **End Caps**: Platform styling matches perfectly 6. **Pattern Validation**: Invalid patterns are automatically prevented at edge positions

### User Experience

- **Predictable Behavior**: Users can expect the same results from both input methods
- **No Surprises**: Auto-completion works consistently across all interaction modes
- **Visual Feedback**: What users see matches internal game state exactly
- **Smart Validation**: Only valid patterns are accessible for each block position, preventing impossible configurations

```c
// OLD CODE
apply_pattern_to_tilemap(char_index, valid_pattern);

// NEW CODE
apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(char_index, valid_pattern);
```

This means that when a user enters a code letter, the pattern is now applied using the same logic as manual painting.

### 3. Tilemap Reconstruction Function Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the pattern drawing system so that when a code letter is entered, the corresponding platform pattern is looked up and drawn using the same brush logic as manual tilemap editing. This ensures visual and logical consistency between code entry and manual painting.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Missing Constants

**Issue**: `PLATFORM_X_MAX` and `PLATFORM_X_MIN` constants were not defined in `code_gen.c`, causing compilation errors.

**Solution**: Added the missing platform boundary constants to match those in `paint.c`:

```c
#define PLATFORM_X_MIN 2
#define PLATFORM_X_MAX 21
```

### 2. Enhanced Pattern Validation

**Issue**: Certain patterns should not be available in specific block positions because they would create invalid single platform tiles at edges.

**Solution**: Enhanced `is_pattern_valid()` function to prevent edge-case patterns:

**Left Edge Blocks (columns 0)** - Blocked patterns with isolated platforms at position 0:

- Pattern 14 (`e`): Two isolated platforms at positions 0,4
- Pattern 18 (`i`): Platforms at positions 0-2,4 (isolated at position 4)

**Right Edge Blocks (columns 3)** - Blocked patterns with isolated platforms at position 4:

- Pattern 1 (`1`): Single platform at position 4
- Pattern 9 (`9`): Patterns at positions 1-2,4 (isolated at position 4)
- Pattern 14 (`e`): Two isolated platforms at positions 0,4
- Pattern 18 (`i`): Platforms at positions 0-2,4 (isolated at position 4)

**Character Cycling**: When cycling through patterns (pressing a key on level code), invalid patterns are automatically skipped, ensuring users can only access valid patterns for each position.

### 3. New Brush Logic Function (`apply_pattern_with_brush_logic`)

**Location**: `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c`

Created a new function that applies patterns using the same logic as manual painting:

```c
void apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED
```

**Key Features**:

- Places individual platform tiles based on the pattern bitmask
- Uses `rebuild_platform_row()` to apply proper styling and auto-completion
- Updates level code for all affected segments to capture auto-completion effects
- Ensures consistency with manual painting behavior

### 4. Updated Code Entry System

**Change**: Modified `update_level_code_from_character_edit()` to use the new brush logic:

```c
// OLD CODE
apply_pattern_to_tilemap(char_index, valid_pattern);

// NEW CODE
apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(char_index, valid_pattern);
```

This means that when a user enters a code letter, the pattern is now applied using the same logic as manual painting.

### 5. Tilemap Reconstruction Function

**Added**: `reconstruct_tilemap_from_level_code()` function that rebuilds the entire tilemap from loaded level code using brush logic.

**Usage**: Called when loading level codes to ensure the tilemap matches the saved patterns with proper auto-completion.

### 6. Updated Loading Functions

**Enhanced**: Both variable-based and SRAM-based level code loading now call the reconstruction function:

```c
void vm_load_level_code(SCRIPT_CTX *THIS) BANKED
{
    load_level_code_from_variables();
    reconstruct_tilemap_from_level_code(); // NEW: Apply patterns using brush logic
    force_complete_level_code_display();
}
```

## Auto-Completion Behavior

### Single Empty Tile Completion

**Before**: Patterns ending with a single empty tile next to a platform edge would only place what was explicitly in the pattern.

**After**: Such patterns now trigger auto-completion, just like manual painting:

- If a pattern ends with a single empty tile next to a platform edge, a second tile is automatically added
- This matches the behavior users see when manually painting platforms
- Both the visual tilemap and internal block codes are updated to reflect the completion

### Platform Merging

**Consistency**: Patterns now merge with adjacent platforms using the same rules as manual painting:

- Proper end cap detection and removal when platforms connect
- 8-tile platform length limit enforcement
- Identical visual results whether using code entry or manual painting

## Implementation Details

### Function Dependencies

The new system leverages existing manual painting functions:

1. **`rebuild_platform_row()`**: Handles styling, auto-completion, and platform merging
2. **`update_level_code_for_paint()`**: Updates internal state to match visual changes
3. **`extract_platform_data()`**: Re-extracts platform patterns after auto-completion

### Backward Compatibility

- **Pattern Definitions**: All existing platform patterns (0-20) remain unchanged
- **Storage Format**: Level code storage and encoding are unaffected
- **Legacy Functions**: `apply_pattern_to_tilemap()` still exists for any other uses

### Update Scope

The refactor affects platforms applied through:

- ✅ **Code entry** (typing letters in level code display)
- ✅ **Level code loading** (from variables or SRAM)
- ❌ **Manual painting** (unchanged - already used brush logic)

## Result

### Perfect Consistency

Code entry and manual painting now produce identical results in all scenarios:

1. **Visual Appearance**: Platforms look exactly the same regardless of creation method
2. **Auto-Completion**: Single platforms at edges get completed consistently
3. **Platform Merging**: Adjacent platforms merge using identical rules
4. **Length Limits**: 8-tile limit enforced uniformly
5. **End Caps**: Platform styling matches perfectly

### User Experience

- **Predictable Behavior**: Users can expect the same results from both input methods
- **No Surprises**: Auto-completion works consistently across all interaction modes
- **Visual Feedback**: What users see matches internal game state exactly

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c`
- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/include/code_gen.h`

### Functions Added

- `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic()`

- `vm_load_level_code_sram()`

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the implementation works correctly:

1. **Manual vs Code Comparison**:

   - Manually paint a platform pattern
   - Clear and enter the corresponding code letter
   - Verify identical visual and logical results

2. **Auto-Completion Test**:

   - Use patterns that end with single platforms at edges
   - Confirm they auto-complete to 2 tiles when appropriate
   - Verify both tilemap and level code are updated

3. **Loading Test**:

   - Save a level code with auto-completion patterns
   - Load the code and verify platforms appear with proper completion
   - Check that the loaded result matches manual painting of the same pattern

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test platform merging at segment boundaries
   - Verify 8-tile limit enforcement
   - Confirm proper end cap styling

The refactor ensures that decoded patterns visually match what would happen if the user painted the same blocks manually, including auto-completing platforms and updating both the visual tilemap and internal block codes accordingly.

## Latest Fix: Adjacent Block Level Code Sync (COMPLETE)

### Final Issue Resolved

Fixed the "one change late" problem where neighboring block codes weren't updated immediately when auto-completion affected them.

### Solution

- Added `update_neighboring_block_codes()` function to check and update all adjacent blocks
- Added `update_single_block_code()` function to extract and update individual block patterns
- Enhanced `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic()` to call neighbor updates after pattern application

### Result

✅ **Immediate Sync**: All affected block codes now update immediately when patterns with auto-completion are applied
✅ **Perfect Consistency**: Code entry now behaves identically to manual painting in all scenarios
✅ **No Performance Impact**: Only affected neighbor blocks are checked and updated

**Documentation**: See `ADJACENT_BLOCK_LEVELCODE_SYNC_FIX.md` for complete technical details.

TODO:
Can you create an event for me that I can call when I move to the next code charater that updated the x,y value code I give you to make sure it show the right code. For example, if we tried pattern 1, there's a chance nothing will draw, so when I move to the next code char it should update that 1 to the current block's pattern code.
