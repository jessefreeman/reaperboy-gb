# Adjacent Block Level Code Sync Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem

When entering code letters that trigger auto-completion into neighboring blocks, the neighboring blocks' level codes were not updated immediately. This caused a "one change late" issue where:

1. Enter code `1` (single platform at position 4)
2. Pattern applies correctly, auto-completes into neighbor block
3. Visual tilemap shows correct result
4. **BUG**: Neighbor block still shows old code until another change occurs
5. Enter code `2` - NOW the neighbor block code updates to reflect the previous change

## Root Cause

The `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic` function was calling `paint(x, y)` for each tile, which correctly handled auto-completion and merging. However, each `paint()` call only updated the level code for the immediate block it was in via `update_level_code_for_paint()`. When auto-completion affected neighboring blocks, those neighboring blocks didn't get their level codes updated.

## Solution

Enhanced `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic` to explicitly update neighboring block codes after applying the pattern:

### 1. New Function: `update_neighboring_block_codes()`

```c
void update_neighboring_block_codes(UBYTE block_index) BANKED
{
    // Check horizontal neighbors (left and right)
    UBYTE current_row = block_index / SEGMENTS_PER_ROW;

    // Left neighbor
    if ((block_index % SEGMENTS_PER_ROW) > 0)
    {
        UBYTE left_neighbor = block_index - 1;
        update_single_block_code(left_neighbor);
    }

    // Right neighbor
    if ((block_index % SEGMENTS_PER_ROW) < (SEGMENTS_PER_ROW - 1))
    {
        UBYTE right_neighbor = block_index + 1;
        update_single_block_code(right_neighbor);
    }

    // Vertical neighbors (above and below)
    // [Similar logic for vertical neighbors]
}
```

### 2. New Function: `update_single_block_code()`

```c
void update_single_block_code(UBYTE block_index) BANKED
{
    if (block_index >= TOTAL_BLOCKS)
        return;

    // Calculate segment position
    UBYTE block_x = block_index % SEGMENTS_PER_ROW;
    UBYTE block_y = block_index / SEGMENTS_PER_ROW;
    UBYTE segment_x = 2 + block_x * SEGMENT_WIDTH;
    UBYTE segment_y = PLATFORM_Y_MIN + block_y * SEGMENT_HEIGHT;

    // Extract the current pattern from the tilemap
    UBYTE row0, row1;
    UWORD pattern = extract_chunk_pattern(segment_x, segment_y, &row0, &row1);
    UWORD pattern_id = match_platform_pattern(pattern);

    // Update the level code if it changed
    if (current_level_code.platform_patterns[block_index] != (UBYTE)pattern_id)
    {
        current_level_code.platform_patterns[block_index] = (UBYTE)pattern_id;
        mark_display_position_for_update(block_index);
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic()`

```c
void apply_pattern_with_brush_logic(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED
{
    // ...existing pattern application logic...

    // NEW: Update level codes for neighboring blocks that might have been affected
    update_neighboring_block_codes(block_index);
}
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Auto-Completion Scenario

1. Enter code `1` (single platform at position 4)
2. Pattern applies using brush logic
3. Auto-completion creates platforms in neighbor block
4. **FIXED**: Immediate level code extraction and update for all affected blocks
5. Neighbor block code displays correct pattern immediately

### Platform Merging Scenario

1. Have existing platform in one block
2. Enter adjacent pattern that merges with existing platform
3. Platform merger removes end caps, extends platforms
4. **FIXED**: All affected blocks show correct codes immediately

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations

- Only checks direct neighbors (up to 4 blocks maximum)
- Only updates blocks where the pattern actually changed
- Uses existing `extract_chunk_pattern()` and `match_platform_pattern()` functions
- Marks specific positions for selective display update (no full screen refresh)

### Integration

- Preserves all existing paint logic and auto-completion behavior
- No changes to manual painting workflow
- No changes to pattern storage or encoding
- Maintains compatibility with all existing level code functions

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c`
- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/include/code_gen.h`

### Functions Added

- `update_neighboring_block_codes()`
- `update_single_block_code()`

### Functions Modified

- `apply_pattern_with_brush_logic()` - added neighbor update call

## Result

Code entry now behaves identically to manual painting in all scenarios:

✅ **Immediate Updates**: All affected block codes update immediately
✅ **Auto-Completion**: Neighbor blocks reflect auto-completion immediately  
✅ **Platform Merging**: Merged platform codes update immediately
✅ **Visual Consistency**: Display always matches internal state
✅ **No Performance Impact**: Only affected blocks are updated

The "one change late" issue is completely resolved. Users can now enter code letters and see all affected block codes update immediately, exactly as if they had painted the pattern manually. 3. **Block 1's level code doesn't update** → Still shows previous pattern (like `0`) even though it now has a platform tile

### Root Cause

The `paint()` function calls `update_level_code_for_paint(x, y)` only for the specific coordinate where the paint was initiated. When auto-completion extends the platform into adjacent tiles, those locations don't get their level codes updated automatically.

```c
// From paint.c - only updates for the original paint location
paint(tile_x, current_y);  // This calls update_level_code_for_paint(tile_x, current_y)
// But if paint() creates a 2-tile platform extending to tile_x+1,
// the level code for tile_x+1's block doesn't get updated
```

## Solution Implemented

Added comprehensive level code updates after pattern application to ensure all potentially affected blocks have their level codes refreshed.

### New Code Addition

```c
// After applying the pattern, update level codes for all potentially affected blocks
// This ensures that auto-completion that extends into adjacent blocks gets reflected in their level codes
for (UBYTE row = 0; row < SEGMENT_HEIGHT; row++)
{
    UBYTE current_y = segment_y + row;

    // Update level code for all blocks in this row that might have been affected
    // Check blocks from left edge to right edge, not just the current segment
    for (UBYTE check_x = PLATFORM_X_MIN; check_x <= PLATFORM_X_MAX; check_x += SEGMENT_WIDTH)
    {
        // Only update if this is a valid block boundary
        if (check_x <= PLATFORM_X_MAX - SEGMENT_WIDTH + 1)
        {
            update_level_code_for_paint(check_x, current_y);
        }
    }
}
```

## How the Fix Works

### ✅ **Comprehensive Block Scanning**

- After pattern application, scan all blocks in the affected rows
- Call `update_level_code_for_paint()` for each block boundary
- This captures any changes that might have affected adjacent blocks

### ✅ **Row-by-Row Updates**

- Process both rows of the 2-row segment
- Ensures both top and bottom platform rows get their level codes updated
- Covers all potentially affected blocks in the segment area

### ✅ **Boundary-Aware Updates**

- Check from `PLATFORM_X_MIN` to `PLATFORM_X_MAX` in `SEGMENT_WIDTH` increments
- Only update valid block boundaries (prevents out-of-bounds updates)
- Covers blocks 0, 1, 2, 3 (positions 2, 7, 12, 17 in tilemap coordinates)

## Example Scenario: Pattern `1` Auto-Completion

### Before Fix

1. Apply pattern `1` to block 0 (columns 0)
2. `paint()` creates 2-tile platform: position 4 of block 0 + position 0 of block 1
3. Block 0 level code updates → Shows pattern `1` ✅
4. Block 1 level code **doesn't update** → Still shows `0` ❌
5. **Visual mismatch**: Block 1 shows pattern `0` but has a platform tile

### After Fix

1. Apply pattern `1` to block 0 (columns 0)
2. `paint()` creates 2-tile platform: position 4 of block 0 + position 0 of block 1
3. Block 0 level code updates → Shows pattern `1` ✅
4. **Comprehensive update phase runs**
5. `update_level_code_for_paint()` called for all blocks in affected rows
6. Block 1 level code updates → Shows correct pattern reflecting the new platform tile ✅
7. **Visual consistency**: All blocks show accurate patterns

## Benefits

### 🎯 **Perfect Level Code Sync**

- All blocks always show the correct pattern for their actual tile content
- No more visual mismatches between level code display and actual tilemap

### 🎯 **Handles All Auto-Completion Cases**

- Single platform auto-completion extending into next block
- Platform merging that affects multiple blocks
- Any scenario where paint actions affect adjacent areas

### 🎯 **Maintains Performance**

- Only updates level codes, doesn't re-render tiles
- Uses existing `update_level_code_for_paint()` function
- Minimal overhead for comprehensive accuracy

## Files Modified

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` - Added comprehensive level code updates after pattern application

## Dependencies

- `update_level_code_for_paint(UBYTE x, UBYTE y)` - Existing function to refresh level code for a block
- `PLATFORM_X_MIN`, `PLATFORM_X_MAX`, `SEGMENT_WIDTH` - Boundary constants

## Result

Pattern application now maintains perfect synchronization between:

- ✅ **Visual tilemap** - What you see on screen
- ✅ **Level code display** - The characters shown for each block
- ✅ **Internal level code data** - The stored pattern values

When pattern `1` extends into an adjacent block, both the current block and the adjacent block immediately show the correct level code patterns that reflect their actual tile content.
