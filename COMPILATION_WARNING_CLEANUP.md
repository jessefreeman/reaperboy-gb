# Compilation Warning Cleanup

## Warning Fixed

**Warning**: `warning 85: in function is_pattern_valid unreferenced function argument : 'block_index'`

### Root Cause

After rolling back the edge validation system, the `is_pattern_valid()` function was simplified to only check if the pattern ID is within valid range. However, the function signature still included the unused `block_index` parameter.

```c
// OLD - block_index parameter was unused after rollback
UBYTE is_pattern_valid(UBYTE block_index, UBYTE pattern_id) BANKED
{
    // Only used pattern_id, block_index was ignored
    return (pattern_id < PLATFORM_PATTERN_COUNT) ? 1 : 0;
}
```

### Solution: Complete Function Removal

Since the function was no longer being called anywhere in the codebase (all validation logic was removed during the rollback), the cleanest solution was to remove the function entirely.

**Files Modified:**

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` - Removed function definition
- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/include/code_gen.h` - Removed function declaration

### Impact

- ✅ **Compilation warning eliminated**
- ✅ **Code simplified** - No unused validation functions
- ✅ **No functional changes** - Function wasn't being used anyway
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase** - Removed legacy validation code

## Other Warnings

The remaining warnings are optimizer notifications:

```
warning 110: conditional flow changed by optimizer: so said EVELYN the modified DOG
```

These are **informational only** and indicate that the compiler optimizer changed conditional flows for better performance. They're common in game development and don't indicate any problems with the code.

## Final State

The pattern application system now has:

- ✅ **No edge validation restrictions** - All patterns work at all positions
- ✅ **True manual paint simulation** - Uses actual `paint()` function calls
- ✅ **Perfect level code synchronization** - Uses `update_complete_level_code()`
- ✅ **Clean compilation** - No functional warnings
- ✅ **Optimized code** - Compiler optimizations applied automatically

The system is ready for production use with full manual painting consistency!
