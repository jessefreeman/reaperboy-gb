# True Manual Paint Simulation Fix - Level Code Update Timing

## Problem: "One Change Late" Level Code Updates

When applying pattern `1`, the visual tilemap would update correctly (creating a 2-tile platform extending into the neighbor block), but the neighbor block's level code would only update after the **next** pattern change, not immediately.

### Root Cause: Conflicting Update Systems

Our pattern application was using **two different update mechanisms**:

1. **Individual paint updates**: Each `paint()` call triggered `update_level_code_for_paint()` for specific zones
2. **Complete override**: Final `update_complete_level_code()` call re-extracted ALL level codes

This created a timing conflict where individual updates were being overridden by the final complete update.

### The Problem Flow

```c
// Pattern application process (BEFORE FIX)
paint(tile_x, current_y);  // Creates 2-tile platform, updates level codes
// ... more paint calls ...
update_complete_level_code();  // OVERRIDES previous updates, re-extracts everything
```

**Result**: The final extraction might not capture intermediate states properly, causing the "one change late" behavior.

## Solution: Pure Manual Paint Simulation

Removed the final `update_complete_level_code()` call to let each individual `paint()` call handle its own level code updates, exactly like manual painting.

### Fixed Code

```c
// Apply pattern by simulating manual paint clicks from left to right
for (UBYTE i = 0; i < SEGMENT_WIDTH; i++)
{
    if ((row_pattern >> (4 - i)) & 1)
    {
        UBYTE tile_x = segment_x + i;

        if (get_current_tile_type(tile_x, current_y) != BRUSH_TILE_PLATFORM)
        {
            paint(tile_x, current_y);  // Each call updates level codes immediately
        }
    }
}
// NO MORE update_complete_level_code() override!
```

## How This Fixes the Issue

### âœ… **Immediate Updates**

- Each `paint()` call immediately updates level codes via `update_level_code_for_paint()`
- When auto-completion extends into adjacent blocks, those updates happen **immediately**
- No final override to cause timing issues

### âœ… **True Manual Paint Equivalence**

- **Manual painting**: Click tile â†’ `paint()` â†’ `update_level_code_for_paint()` â†’ Immediate level code update
- **Pattern application**: Same sequence, same timing, same results

### âœ… **Sequential Processing**

- Tiles are painted left to right, just like manual painting
- Each paint action can affect the next (platform merging, auto-completion)
- Level codes update progressively as each tile is painted

## Example: Pattern `1` Application

### Before Fix (conflicting updates)

1. Apply pattern `1` to block 0
2. `paint()` creates 2-tile platform â†’ calls `update_level_code_for_paint()` â†’ neighbor updates
3. `update_complete_level_code()` runs â†’ **overrides** individual updates â†’ neighbor reverts
4. **Next pattern change** â†’ `update_complete_level_code()` finally captures the correct state

### After Fix (pure paint simulation)

1. Apply pattern `1` to block 0
2. `paint()` creates 2-tile platform â†’ calls `update_level_code_for_paint()` â†’ neighbor updates **immediately**
3. **No override** â†’ neighbor level code stays correctly updated

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect Timing**

- Level codes update exactly when the visual changes occur
- No delays or "one change late" behavior
- Immediate visual feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ **True Manual Equivalence**

- Pattern application now **IS** manual painting
- Identical code paths, identical timing, identical results
- No separate "pattern logic" vs "manual logic"

### ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified System**

- Removed conflicting update mechanisms
- One paint system, one update system
- Cleaner, more predictable behavior

## Files Modified

- `plugins/TilemapEditor/engine/src/core/code_gen.c` - Removed final `update_complete_level_code()` call

## Result

Pattern application now maintains perfect real-time synchronization:

- âœ… **Visual tilemap**: Updates immediately as each tile is painted
- âœ… **Level code display**: Updates immediately as each block is affected
- âœ… **Manual paint equivalence**: Identical behavior to clicking each tile manually

When you change from pattern `0` to pattern `1`, the neighbor block's level code will update **immediately**, not one change late!
